Contribute
==========

We welcome community contributions to the documentation.

Here's how you can help.

Providing Feedback
----------------

You don't have to write documentation to help us out; you can submit
feedback from any page by using the "Feedback" tab to the left, or
wherever you see this:

{FEEDBACK}

Feedback is great, and we'd like as much as possible... but if you
know what needs to be added (to something you see, or based on other
user feedback), here's how to contribute directly:

Making a Contribution
---------------------

Version control for the project is handled with
[Git](http://git-scm.com/).

The URL of the repository is: [http://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-docs](http://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-docs)

NOTE: We recommend using a [GitHub](http://github.com) account to
contribute to this project -- but we also accept git patches.  Read
below for more information.

### Fork the project

If you're using Github, [fork](http://help.github.com/forking/) our
repository, and clone your fresh repository:

    $ git clone git@github.com:yourname/puppet-docs.git

If you're not using GitHub, just clone our copy directly (you can push
to your own remote host or provide git patches later):

    $ git clone git://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-docs.git

### Learn how add documentation

Read the
 [README](http://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-docs/blob/master/README.markdown)
and [README_WRITING](http://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-docs/blob/master/README_WRITING.markdown) in the source.

### Make your changes

Add your documentation fixes.

NOTE: If you modify any of the generator (Ruby) code, make sure you
provide passing tests that cover your changes.

### Commit and Push

* If you're using GitHub (or your own hosted repository), push to a
  remote branch.
* If you're not working with a remote, generate a patch of your
  changes for the next step.

NOTE: If you need a refresher on how to commit and work with remote
repositories in Git, you may want to visit [GitHub's articles and
screencasts](http://learn.github.com/).

### Submit a Ticket

Visit the [Puppet Documentation
Project](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet-docs/) and
submit a ticket.  You'll need to create a [Redmine
account](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/account/register) if you
don't already have one.

In your ticket, provide:

1. Any additional background on your change.
2. The versions of Puppet (or supporting project) to which it pertains.

If you feel comfortable with git, feel free to help us by including either
of the following:

3. If using GitHub or another remote host, the URL to the branch
   you're submitting (so we can pull it); if not, one or more attached
   git patches.

We'll get back to you on your contribution as soon as possible.  Thanks!
